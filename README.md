# Vue Blockstack Todo
> Simple todo app using Vue.js and blockstack
# How it Works
Blockstack authenticates users so they can access their personal lists on the app. The lists and all edits are stored by a Blockstack storage system called Gaia.

The frontend aspects that are used by the user are Vue.js.

The Bootstrap framework is used for styling.
